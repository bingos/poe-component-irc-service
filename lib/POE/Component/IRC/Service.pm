=head1 NAME

POE::Component::IRC::Service - a fully event driven IRC Services module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE::Component::IRC::Service;

  # Do this when you create your sessions. 'IRC-Service' is just a
  # kernel alias to christen the new IRC connection with. Returns an
  # object to access the IRC network state.

  my ($ircservice) = POE::Component::IRC::Service->new('IRC-Service','P10') or die "Oh noooo! $!";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::IRC::Service is a POE component borrowed heavily from POE::Component::IRC 
which acts as an easily controllable IRC Services client for your other POE components and
sessions.

The module is a wrapper for various sub components which actually deal with the messy business
of connecting to and returning events from the IRC network, and recording the IRC network state.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new

Takes three arguments: a name (kernel alias) which this new connection
will be known by; the name of the sub-component to invoke; a hashref containing configuration information. Currently
implemented is P10. Hybrid support will be coming soon.

Returns a brand new shiny IRC Service object.

=head1 MAD PROPS

The biggest debt is to Dennis Taylor, E<lt>dennis@funkplanet.comE<gt> for 
creating POE::Component::IRC and letting me "salvage" his code for this module.
